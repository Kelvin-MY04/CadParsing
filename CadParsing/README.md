# CadParsing Starter Kit

This workspace has been converted into a minimal starter kit targeting .NET 8. It contains a simple console app that prints "Hello World".

Project layout:
- `CadPlugin/` - a small console app that writes a greeting.
- `Program.cs` - top-level host that prints a short message.

How to build and run:
1. From the repository root: `dotnet build`
2. Run the starter app: `dotnet run --project CadParsing/CadPlugin`

Replace the contents of `CadPlugin` with your application code when you are ready to expand the starter kit.
